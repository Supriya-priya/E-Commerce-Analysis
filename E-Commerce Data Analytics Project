## 🗃️ Data Source

The dataset simulates an e-commerce business database with the following key tables:

- **Orders**
- **Customers**
- **Products**
- **Sales**

---

## 🧮 SQL Query Modules

Each query was designed to answer a specific business question:

1. **Credit Limit Monitoring**  
   → Retrieve customer credit limits to assess financial exposure.

2. **Late Shipping Detection**  
   → Identify orders delivered past the requested date.

3. **Over Credit Limit**  
   → Flag customers exceeding their allocated credit limits.

4. **Sales by Region**  
   → Aggregate office sales by customer country.

5. **Frequently Bought Together**  
   → Discover product combinations that are often purchased together.

6. **Country-Level Sales Summary**  
   → Provide performance snapshots by region.

7. **Sales Value Variation**  
   → Track change in order value from one purchase to the next.

## 📊 Excel-Based Analysis

The SQL query results were exported to Excel for charting and further analysis. Pivot charts were created for each query to quickly visualize:

- Credit Limit Distributions
- Impact of Late Shipments
- High-Risk Credit Customers
- Regional Sales Performance
- Product Bundling Patterns
- Country Sales Comparison
- Order-to-Order Sales Value Changes
